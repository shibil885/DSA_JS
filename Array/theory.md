<details>
  <summary>1. What is the difference between an array and a list?</summary>

**Answer:**

- **Array** is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **List** (like a Linked List) can be dynamic and non-contiguous.
- Arrays provide fast access (O(1)), while lists provide faster insertion/deletion (O(1) at head).

  <summary>1. Two Sum</summary>

**Problem:**  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

**Approach:**

- Use a HashMap to store value and index.
- For each element, check if `target - current` exists in the map.

```ts
function twoSum(nums: number[], target: number): number[] {

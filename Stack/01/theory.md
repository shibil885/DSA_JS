# 📚 Stack - Theory Question (Day 1)

## ❓ Question

**What are the real-world applications of stack?**

---

## 📖 Answer

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO** (Last In, First Out) principle.

## 🌍 Real-World Applications of Stack

### 1. 🔙 **Undo/Redo Operations**

- Used in text editors like VS Code, MS Word, Notepad, etc.
- Each action is pushed to a stack, allowing reversal (`undo`) or reapplication (`redo`).

---

### 2. 📞 **Function Call Stack**

- During program execution, function calls are managed using a stack.
- Helps in **tracking return addresses**, **parameters**, and **local variables**.

### 3. 🧭 **Browser History Navigation**

- The "Back" and "Forward" buttons work using two stacks:
  - One stack for visited pages (back)
  - One for pages you can revisit (forward)

### 4. 🧮 **Expression Evaluation and Parsing**

- Used in evaluating expressions:
  - Infix → Postfix/Prefix conversion
  - Postfix expression evaluation (like `3 4 +`)
- Also used in compilers and interpreters.

---

### 5. 🏗️ **Syntax Parsing**

- Compilers use stacks for syntax checking (like balanced parentheses, brackets).

---

### 6. 📦 **Recursive Algorithms**

- All recursion internally uses a **call stack** to manage recursive calls.
- E.g., DFS in trees and graphs, factorial calculation, Fibonacci series.

---

### 7. 📐 **Backtracking Problems**

- Used in puzzles like:
  - Sudoku Solver
  - N-Queens Problem
  - Maze Solving
- Stack helps to **explore paths and backtrack** when a dead-end is hit.

---

### 8. 🧰 **Memory Management**

- Stack memory is used for storing local variables during execution.
- Fast allocation/deallocation.

## 🧠 Summary

| Application Area      | Example                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Text Editor           | Undo/Redo operations               |
| Web Browsers          | Back/Forward navigation            |
| Programming Languages | Function call management           |
| Algorithms            | DFS, backtracking, parsing         |
| Compilers             | Syntax validation, expression eval |

## 🏁 Conclusion

Stacks are **everywhere** — from apps we use daily to low-level program execution.  
Their **LIFO behavior** makes them perfect for undo actions, recursion, and parsing logic.
